# Petschko's RPG-Maker-MV & MZ File-Decrypter

## What's that?

This Project is used to Decrypt (and Re-Encrypt) RPG-Maker-MV-Resource-Files (MZ-Files as well) and that are encrypted with the Build-In-Encryption of the RPG-Maker.

This Project is mostly used for Single-File decryption. >.< Please try out the [Java-Decrypter](https://github.com/Petschko/Java-RPG-Maker-MV-Decrypter) if you want decrypt huge amounts of Files (or more Projects)

### Motivation behind this
As Art-Creator for the RPG-Maker by myself, it is sometimes hard to figure out, if somebody is using Resources from you (and may violate the licence like giving no credit or using a Non-Commercial-Resource in a Commercial Game for example).

I don't have time to play through all the games so i just quick look at the files but its only possible if the files are not encrypted...

Sad for me, more People use the build in Encryption from the RPG-Maker-MV so that's why I wrote this script - to get a quick look at the files without playing the whole game =) May some other artists will find this useful too.

### Legal-Notification
You are **not allowed** to use the Decrypted Files (**if its not allowed by the origin File-Licence**).
Please don't steal and reuse stuff that's not the idea of this Script!
You can save them for Private-Use only. If the origin Licence allow use you can use them of course but please follow the licences!

**If that's your Project** and you simply lost your Origin-Files, **you have the same rights**, to do stuff with them, **as before** =)

## Requirements
- Web-Browser with HTML5 Support

## Installation

This is very easy:

- Download/Clone the Project OR direct use [it on my site](https://petschko.org/tools/mv_decrypter/)
- Extract/Put it where ever you want
- Done :)

## How to use?

### If you downloaded this Script on your Computer (Pre Step)
- You have to open the "index.html" file with you Browser like:
  - Use right click and open with... _(Then select your Favorite Browser)_
  - Use double click to open the file. Many Browsers set them as default applications for html files

### Use this Script now

#### Decryption
You want to see the Source-Files? Here you go:
- Open the directory of the Game with the encrypted Audio/Images
  - Check if the Files have one of the File-Extensions:
    - ".rpgmvp" (PNG-Files)
    - ".rpgmvm" (m4a-Files)
    - ".rpgmvo" (ogg-Files)
    - ".png_" (PNG-Files)
    - ".m4a_" (m4a-Files)
    - ".ogg_" (ogg-Files)
  - If the Files doesn't have this Extensions the Creator used an other Encryption/Pack-Tool. If that's the case you can't use this script for this Project.
- Get the Encryption-Key (This step isn't needed for Images)
  - Select with the first File-Picker the "System.json"-File which contains the "raw"-Encryption-Key
    - The File is located in `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/www/data/System(.json)` for RPG-Maker MV
    - The File is located in `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/data/System(.json)` for RPG-Maker MZ
    - You can also use an Encrypted Image-File from the Project (`.rpgmvp` / `.png_`) to detect the Key
  - Click on the Detect-Button - If it finds the Key, it will automatically insert it for you within the next Input-Field
- Select the Encrypted Audio/Image-Files to decrypt
- Click on the Decrypt-Button
  - **IF** you get an invalid Header Warning, turn off the Header Check. Just select "No" under `Verify Fake-Header?` and try again!
- The Decrypted-File(s) are shown in a File-List, next to or below _(on tiny screens)_ the De/Encrypt-Button. You can open them and/or save them (or just view/listen)
  - Some Browser-Plugins like [UBlockOrigin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) may block previewing the File. Disable it or explicit say `Open in new Tab`

#### Encryption
You want turn back an Image into the Game _(If you have translated text or fixed something on an Image)_?

Here you go:
- You need to check if you have one of these File-Types to turn back into the Game:
  - PNG-File (.png) - _Image-Format **make sure that's PNG** not JPG or something different_
  - m4a-File (.m4a) - _Sound Format_
  - ogg-File (.ogg) - _Sound and/or Video Format_
- If you have the Files in these Format you can go on, else turn them into the correct Format. (You should know how or [how to Google](http://www.giyf.com/))
- Like with decryption we need the Encryption-Key to encrypt your files correctly back for the Game
  - Select with the first File-Picker the "System.json"-File which contains the "raw"-Encryption-Key
    - The File is located in `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/www/data/System(.json)` for RPG-Maker MV
    - The File is located in `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/data/System(.json)` for RPG-Maker MZ
    - You can also use an Encrypted Image-File from the Project (`.rpgmvp` / `.png_`) to detect the Key
  - Click on the Detect-Button - If it finds the Key, it will automatically insert it for you within the next Input-Field
- Make sure that `Verify Fake-Header?` is enabled (on YES). If not select it.
  - This checks if the Game can read this File
- Select the File(s) you want Encrypt
- Click on the (Re)-Encrypt-Button (Of the RPG-Maker which is used)
  - **IF** you get an Error please check if you did all steps right before! Also check if the Header-Values are on default:
    - Click on `Header-Values (Show)`
    - Click on `Reset Header-Values to default` and click `OK` in the Confirmation box
    - Try again
- The (Re)-Encrypted-File(s) are shown in a File-List, next to or below _(on tiny screens)_ the De/Encrypt-Button. You can't open them _(because its encrypted)_ but you should save them
- Overwrite the File in your Game
- Start the Game and check if the File is been displayed
  - **If the File is not displayed**: (This is very rare ~1/100 Games - Usually you get an Header-Error while you Decrypt Files from these Games them with the default Header-Values, that's an strong indicator that this Game has different Header-Values)
    - You have to set different Header-Values, for this you have to open this File: `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/www/js/rpg_core.js`
      - For RPG-Maker-MZ the File is here: `%PROJECT_DIRECTORY%/js/rpg_core.js`
    - There you find the Decrypter-Class, its an insane long File so use the Search function (Strg/Ctrl + F) and search for this String: `function Decrypter()`
    - There are Values sort below, like this:
    ````js
    Decrypter.hasEncryptedImages = false;
    Decrypter.hasEncryptedAudio = false;
    Decrypter._requestImgFile = [];
    Decrypter._headerlength = 16; // <-- Header-Length (In Bytes)
    Decrypter._xhrOk = 400;
    Decrypter._encryptionKey = "";
    Decrypter._ignoreList = [
        "img/system/Window.png"
    ];
    Decrypter.SIGNATURE = "5250474d56000000"; // <-- Header-Signature
    Decrypter.VER = "000301"; // <-- Header-Version
    Decrypter.REMAIN = "0000000000"; // <-- Header-Remain
    ````
    Make sure that you copy the values (which have similar names to the fields in the Header-Info Form - I showed you them in my example above)
    - Try to encrypt the File(s) again
